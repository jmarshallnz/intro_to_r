RStudio is freely available and runs on Windows, Mac, and Linux operating systems. There are also web-based methods for running RStudio, but we recommend that you download the correct version for your operating system at the beginning of the semester.

Please download and install the latest version, even if you have an older version already installed - you're less likely to have problems if everything is up to date.

You need to download two things: R (the bit that does all the work) and RStudio (the bit we interact with).

### Downloading and installing R

#### Windows users

You can download R from the R project webpage by clicking on this link:

https://cran.rstudio.com/bin/windows/base/

Once downloaded, click on the installer and follow the instructions.

#### Mac Users

You can download R from the R project webpage by clicking on this link:

https://cran.rstudio.com/bin/macosx/

When you download the `.pkg` file, youâ€™ll need to open the `.pkg` and then run the installer.

The Mac version of R requires OSX 10.13 High Sierra or later. If your machine uses an older version of the Mac OS, then you will experience difficulty. If you cannot use a recent version of the Mac OS, or another computer, then please make contact with course staff.

### Downloading and installing RStudio

You can download RStudio from the [RStudio download page](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download). You want the "RStudio Desktop Open Source License" version. Once downloaded, run the installer and you should be good to go.

#### Mac users

The Mac version of RStudio comes as a `.dmg` (disk image). You should open the downloaded file, and then drag the RStudio icon into the Applications folder to install. Once done, the `.dmg` file is no longer required.

### Installing packages

It's recommended to install a few packages. The main one is the `tidyverse` package.

1. In RStudio, click on the **Packages** tab in the bottom right pane.
2. Click "Install".
3. Type in the name of the package, e.g. `tidyverse`.
4. Click install.

RStudio may suggest that other packages should be installed as well. Usually that is fine. Just agree and sit back while everything is setup.
