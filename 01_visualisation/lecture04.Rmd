## Data today

We'll use the penguins data again today.

A reminder that the penguin data is available here: https://github.com/allisonhorst/palmerpenguins

In addition, we'll use immunisation data from the Ministry of Health.

The data is originally from: https://www.health.govt.nz/our-work/preventative-health-wellness/immunisation/immunisation-coverage/national-and-dhb-immunisation-data

It has been cleaned up, and we'll only be dealing with a small subset of the data. In particular, the number of 2 year olds immunised
in 2012 versus 2019 by ethnicity.

---

## Data today

We have the number of 2 year olds immunised in 2012 and 2019 by ethnicity:

```{r, include=FALSE}
library(lubridate)
all_vacc <- read_csv(here::here("data/vaccinations.csv")) %>%
  filter(DHB == "National") %>%
  mutate(Year = year(Date)) %>%
  filter(Year %in% c(2012, 2019)) %>%
  filter(Ethnicity != "Total") %>%
  filter(Age == "24 months") %>%
  pivot_longer(Immunised:Eligible, names_to = "Item", values_to = "value") %>%
  group_by(Year, Ethnicity, Item) %>%
  summarise(value = sum(value)) %>%
  ungroup() %>%
  mutate(Ethnicity = str_replace(Ethnicity, "Maori", "Māori"),
         Ethnicity = str_replace(Ethnicity, "NZE", "NZ European")) %>%
  mutate(Year = factor(Year))
vacc <- all_vacc %>%
  filter(Item == "Immunised") %>%
  rename(Number = value) %>%
  select(Year, Ethnicity, Number)
vacc_rates <- all_vacc %>%
  pivot_wider(names_from = Item, values_from=value) %>%
  mutate(Percent = round(Immunised/Eligible * 100,1)) %>%
  select(Year, Ethnicity, Percent)
```

```{r}

# Relationships between quantitative variables

## Relationships between quantitative variables

- A **scatter plot** is usually the best display for comparing quantitative variables.

- We're interested in what the trend is.

- Is it going up? Is it going down?

- Is it straight or curved?

- How closely do points cluster around the trend? Do they cluster tightly around the trend (a strong relationship)? Is the amount of clustering consistent?


---

.left-code[
## Example: Penguins

```{r peng_scatter1, eval=FALSE}
ggplot(data = penguins) +
  geom_point(
    mapping = aes(
      x = flipper_length_mm,
      y = body_mass_g
      )
    )
```

As expected, increasing flipper length means
increasing body mass.

A straight line would fit OK.

There's still quite a bit of scatter around
the line.

Flipper length doesn't explain all of body mass - other things
affect body mass too.
]

.right-plot[
```{r, ref.label="peng_scatter1", echo=FALSE, message=FALSE}
```
]

---

## Relationship between qualitative variables

We treat one variable as the **response**. This goes on the y axis.

We treat the other variable as **explanatory**. This goes on the x axis.

The response is often referred to as the **dependent** variable - indicating that it's value might depend on the value of the explanatory variable.

The explanatory variables are referred to as being **independent** - it doesn't depend on the response.

Choosing which is which is somewhat arbitrary, but there's often ways that make more sense than others. e.g. having body mass be determined
by flipper size means that we could add in other independent variables later (e.g. like height) which would also affect body mass.

---

## Scatterplot examples

```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.dim=c(8, 4.)}
set.seed(5)
x1 <- rnorm(100)
y1 <- x1 + rnorm(100, sd=0.5)
y1[13] <- 1.2
x2 <- x1
y2 <- (x2+2.5)^3 + rnorm(100, sd=10)
set.seed(7)
x3 <- rnorm(100)
y3 <- -x3 + rnorm(100, sd=0.2)
set.seed(13)
x4 <- rnorm(100)
y4 <- rnorm(100)
d <- data.frame(x=c(x1, x2, x3, x3), y=c(y1,y2,y3,y4), g=rep(1:4, each=100))
ggplot(d, aes(x=x, y=y)) + geom_point(alpha=0.6, size=2) + facet_wrap(~g, ncol=2, scales='free') +
  theme_bw() +
  theme(axis.title=element_blank(),
        axis.text=element_blank(),
        axis.ticks=element_blank(),
        strip.background = element_blank(),
        strip.text = element_blank()
        )
```

---

## Extreme observations (Outliers)

Outliers on scatter plots can be points that have extreme `x` or `y` values. These will be outliers when you look at `x` or `y` separately.

Or they could have normal `x` and `y` values, but are still extreme compared to the rest of the data due to the pairing being unusual.

The only way to see the second kind is from a scatterplot.

---

## Covariance and correlation

Just like there are numeric summaries for single quantiative variables, there are similar summaries for two variables.

The concepts of center are the same (i.e. the 'center' of a scatterplot is likely $(\bar{x}, \bar{y})$)

But we have different concepts of spread. We have $\sigma_x$ and $\sigma_y$ for the standard deviation of $x$ and $y$ but
that doesn't convey how $y$ changes with $x$ and vice-versa.

There are two additional measures we can use: **covariance** and **correlation**.

---

## Covariance

Recall that the **variance** of a single variable $x$ is given by:

$$
\mathsf{var}(x) = \frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^n (x_i - \bar{x})^2.
$$

The **covariance** of $x$ and $y$ is given by

$$
\mathsf{cov}(x,y) = \frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^n (x_i - \bar{x})(y_i - \bar{y}).
$$

In RStudio, we use the `cov()` function for this.

---

## Correlation

The **correlation** of $x$ and $y$ is given as

$$
\mathsf{cor}(x,y) = \frac{\mathsf{cov}(x,y)}{\mathsf{sd}(x)\mathsf{sd}(y)}
$$

The division by the standard deviations ensures that correlation is not affected by scale: Multiply $x$ by 5 and you'll get the same correlation. Add 1000 to $y$ and you'll get the same correlation.

It is also symmetric:

$$
\mathsf{cor}(x,y) = \mathsf{cor}(y,x).
$$

In RStudio, we use the `cor()` function for this.

---

.left-code[
## Example: Penguins

```{r peng_corr1}
summarise(penguins,
          cov = cov(
            flipper_length_mm,
            body_mass_g
          ),
          r = cor(
            flipper_length_mm,
            body_mass_g
          )
        )
```

]

.right-plot[
```{r echo=FALSE, message=FALSE}
ggplot(data = penguins) +
  geom_point(
    mapping = aes(
      x = flipper_length_mm,
      y = body_mass_g
      )
    )
```
]


---

## Correlation

The correlation coefficient is sometimes represented by $\rho$ or $r$.

It measures the amount that $y$ depends on $x$ through a **straight-line relationship**.

It is always in the range -1 to 1.

 - A value of 1 indicates a perfect, positive straight line relationship.

 - A value of -1 indicates a perfect, negative straight line relationship.

 - A value of 0 indicates no relationship at all.

If the data don't look as though a straight line would be appropriate, then the correlation coefficient might not be what you want.

**Always look at your data**

---

```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.dim=c(8,4.8), fig.retina=3}
library(mvtnorm)
library(tidyverse)
rho <- data.frame(rho = c(0.95, 0.9, 0.6, 0.3, 0, -0.3, -0.6, -0.9, -0.95))
mu <-c(0,0)
rcorr <- function(rho, n) {
  dat <- rmvnorm(n, sigma = matrix(c(1, rho, rho, 1),2))
  while (abs(cor(dat[,1], dat[,2])-rho) > 0.01) {
    dat <- rmvnorm(n, sigma = matrix(c(1, rho, rho, 1),2))
  }
  data.frame(x = dat[,1], y = dat[,2])
}
dat <- rho %>% mutate(data = map(rho, rcorr, n=100)) %>%
  unnest(data)

ggplot(dat) +
  geom_point(aes(x=x, y=y)) +
  facet_wrap(~rho, scales='free', labeller = function(x) { lapply(x, function(x) { paste0('r = ', x) }) }) +
  theme_bw() +
  theme(axis.title = element_blank(),
        axis.text = element_blank(),
        axis.ticks = element_blank())
```

## Beware, Dinosaurs!

All these datasets have the same
correlation.

And the same means for $x$ and $y$

And the same standard deviations!

# Qualitative data

---

## Qualitative data

Qualitative data are categorical.

They may have an order associated with them. In which case, when you summarise, keep them in order.

Or they may be have no order, where you are free to order them as makes sense.

- If ordered, you need to use a `factor` in RStudio.

Small counts (e.g. number of legs) can be considered qualitative.

---

## Summarising qualitative data

The important thing is the number or proportion of observations of each type.

- Present as a table of counts (or proportions/percentages).

- Present a bar chart.

- Present as a pie chart?

---

## Which summary is best?

A table has the advantage of showing actual counts or proportions.

A bar chart will typically allow faster visual comparison of groups. Bars should **always** start at zero.

Pie charts can be useful in some cases (but are so hard to do in `ggplot` that we won't bother)<sup>1</sup>.

Usual charting rules apply:
  - Keep tables and charts free of noise.
  
  - Make the data the key focus.

.footnote[[1] The trick is to create a stacked barchart and switch to polar coordinates...]

---

## Summaries of eye colour

There are two main ways categorical data comes:
- summarised into counts (one row per category)
- or individual rows per observation.

```{r}
eyes <- tibble(colour = c("blue", "grey", "green", "amber", "brown"),
               n = c(32, 15, 12, 16, 25))
eyes
```

---

## Unsummarising data

.pull-left[
The `uncount` function in `tidyr` is useful:

```{r}
long_eyes <- uncount(eyes, n)
long_eyes
```
]

.pull-right[
The `count` function in `dplyr` does the reverse:

```{r}
short_eyes <- count(long_eyes, colour)
short_eyes
```

Notice that the order has changed! We'd need to impose an order to stop this by using a `factor`
]

---

## Factors for categories

```{r}
colours <- c("blue", "grey", "green", "amber", "brown")
```

.pull-left[
```{r}
eyes <- tibble(colour = colours, #<<
               n = c(32, 15, 12, 16, 25))
eyes
eyes$colour
```
]

.pull-right[
```{r}
eyes <- tibble(colour = as_factor(colours), #<<
               n = c(32, 15, 12, 16, 25))
eyes
eyes$colour
```
]

---

.left-code[
## Bar charts in RStudio

For summarised data (i.e. counts) use `geom_col()`.

```{r bar1, eval=FALSE}
ggplot(data = eyes) +
  geom_col(mapping = aes(
    x = colour,
    y = n)
    )
```
]

.right-plot[
```{r, ref.label="bar1", echo=FALSE}
```
]

---

.left-code[
## Bar charts in RStudio

For unsummarised data use `geom_bar()`.

```{r bar2, eval=FALSE}
long_eyes <- uncount(eyes, n)
ggplot(data = long_eyes) +
  geom_bar(mapping = aes(
    x = colour
    )
  )
```

The `y` is computed by `geom_bar()`.
]

.right-plot[
```{r, ref.label="bar2", echo=FALSE}
```
]

---

.left-code[
## Bar charts in RStudio

Use `fill` to change colours.

```{r bar3, eval=FALSE}
long_eyes <- uncount(eyes, n)
ggplot(data = long_eyes) +
  geom_bar(mapping = aes(
    x = colour,
    fill = colour
    )
  )
```
]

.right-plot[
```{r, ref.label="bar3", echo=FALSE}
```
]

---

.left-code[
## Bar charts in RStudio

```{r bar4, eval=FALSE}
long_eyes <- uncount(eyes, n)
ggplot(data = long_eyes) +
  geom_bar(mapping = aes(
    x = colour,
    fill = colour
    )
  ) +
  scale_fill_manual(
    values = c(
      blue = "#1D91C0",
      grey = "#A6BDDB",
      green = "#006837",
      amber = "#885404",
      brown = "#552005"
    )
  )
```

These 'Hex codes' are red, green, blue values in hexadecimal (base 16).

Google 'colour picker' and Copy/Paste.

# Relationships between qualitative data

---

## Relationships between qualitative data

Use cross-tabulation. A table with one variable down the rows and the other across columns.

Use a bar chart with one variable on the `x`-axis, and the other used for `fill` or `colour`.

Compare using proportions instead of counts is useful if group sizes are very different.

A stacked bar chart may be useful for comparing proportions.

---

## Example: Vaccinations

Compare number of 2 year olds immunised in 2012 with those in 2019 by Ethnicity:

```{r}
vacc
```

---

## Example: Vaccinations

```{r}
vacc_wide = pivot_wider(vacc, names_from = Year, values_from = Number)
knitr::kable(vacc_wide, format='html')
```

---

.left-code[
## Example: Vaccinations
```{r vacc_bar1, eval=FALSE}
ggplot(data = vacc) +
  geom_col(mapping = aes(
    x = Year,
    y = Number
    )
  )
```
]

.right-plot[
```{r, ref.label="vacc_bar1", echo=FALSE}
```
]

---

.left-code[
## Example: Vaccinations
```{r vacc_bar2, eval=FALSE}
ggplot(data = vacc) +
  geom_col(mapping = aes(
    x = Year,
    y = Number,
    fill = Ethnicity #<<
    )
  )
```
By default the bars are stacked.

This is equivalent to using `position='stack'`
]

.right-plot[
```{r, ref.label="vacc_bar2", echo=FALSE}
```
]

---

.left-code[
## Example: Vaccinations
```{r vacc_bar4, eval=FALSE}
ggplot(data = vacc) +
  geom_col(mapping = aes(
    x = Year,
    y = Number,
    fill = Ethnicity
    ),
    position = "fill" #<<
  ) +
  labs(y="Proportion") #<<
```
Or we can convert to proportions by filling the
space on the y-axis.
]

.right-plot[
```{r, ref.label="vacc_bar4", echo=FALSE}
```
]

---

.left-code[
## Example: Vaccinations
```{r vacc_bar3, eval=FALSE}
ggplot(data = vacc) +
  geom_col(mapping = aes(
    x = Year,
    y = Number,
    fill = Ethnicity
    ),
    position = "dodge" #<<
  )
```
Use `dodge` to have the bars side by side.
]

.right-plot[
```{r, ref.label="vacc_bar3", echo=FALSE}
```
]

---

.left-code[
## Example: Vaccinations
```{r vacc_bar5, eval=FALSE}
ggplot(data = vacc) +
  geom_col(mapping = aes(
    x = Ethnicity,
    y = Number,
    fill = Year
    ),
    position = "dodge"
  )
```
Swapping the role of the qualitative variables can help answer different questions.
]

.right-plot[
```{r, ref.label="vacc_bar5", echo=FALSE}
```
]

---

## Example: Vaccinations

Be careful here though!

We just have counts of immunised children.

What we really want is the **rates** of immunisation within each ethnic group (i.e. percent immunised).

At the moment we're **assuming** that the total number of children of each ethnicity (including those not immunised) is similar. This may not be the case!

---

## Example: Vaccination rates

It turns out we have that information:

```{r}
vacc_rates_wide <- pivot_wider(vacc_rates, names_from = Year, values_from = Percent)
knitr::kable(vacc_rates_wide, format="html")
```

---

.left-code[
## Example: Vaccinations
```{r vacc_bar6, eval=FALSE}
ggplot(data = vacc_rates) +
  geom_col(mapping = aes(
    x = Ethnicity,
    y = Percent,
    fill = Year
    ),
    position = "dodge"
  )
```
Using the right data is important!
]

.right-plot[
```{r, ref.label="vacc_bar6", echo=FALSE}
```

## Example: COVID-19 testing

A study of 4653 close contacts of cases in Guangzhou, China who were quarantined and tested every 48 hours. The results of the first
test, and whether they were later confirmed to be a case are as follows:

```{r, echo=FALSE}
covid <- tibble::tribble(~Confirmed, ~Test, ~Count,
                         "Yes", "Negative",36,
                         "Yes", "Positive", 92,
                         "No", "Negative",4523,
                         "No", "Positive",2)
pivot_wider(covid, names_from = Test, values_from=Count) %>%
  janitor::adorn_totals(where=c("row", "col")) %>%
  knitr::kable(format='html')
```

Data from Table S3 here: https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.24.20042606v1

---

## Example: COVID-19 testing

Using proportions in this case is probably more useful, as the row and column totals differ a bunch, so hard to compare.

Proportions by row tell us about test performance:
```{r, echo=FALSE}
covid %>% group_by(Confirmed) %>% mutate(Count = round(Count/sum(Count),4)) %>%
  pivot_wider(names_from = Test, values_from=Count) %>%
  knitr::kable(format='html')
```

Proportions by column tell us what to do after a test:
```{r, echo=FALSE}
covid %>% group_by(Test) %>% mutate(Count = round(Count/sum(Count),4)) %>%
  pivot_wider(names_from = Test, values_from=Count) %>%
  knitr::kable(format='html')
```

---

.left-code[
## COVID-19 testing
```{r covid_bar1, eval=FALSE}
ggplot(data = covid) +
  geom_col(mapping = aes(
    x = Confirmed,
    y = Count,
    fill = Test
    ),
    position = "stack"
  )
```

A stacked (or side by side) plot isn't useful
as the counts are very different.
]

.right-plot[
```{r, ref.label="covid_bar1", echo=FALSE}
```
]

---

.left-code[
## COVID-19 testing
```{r covid_bar2, eval=FALSE}
ggplot(data = covid) +
  geom_col(mapping = aes(
    x = Confirmed,
    y = Count,
    fill = Test
    ),
    position = "fill" #<<
  ) +
  labs(y="Proportion")
```

The sensitivity (true positives) of the test
isn't high (around 70%).

The specificity (true negatives) is very high.
]

.right-plot[
```{r, ref.label="covid_bar2", echo=FALSE}
```

---

.left-code[
## COVID-19 testing
```{r covid_bar3, eval=FALSE}
ggplot(data = covid) +
  geom_col(mapping = aes(
    x = Test,
    y = Count,
    fill = Confirmed
    ),
    position = "fill"
  ) +
  labs(y="Proportion")
```

A positive test suggests you're likely to have COVID-19.

A negative test though allows a few cases to slip through.

In the proportion plot, this doesn't look too bad.
]

.right-plot[
```{r, ref.label="covid_bar3", echo=FALSE}

---

.left-code[
## COVID-19 testing
```{r covid_bar4, eval=FALSE}
cases <- filter(covid,
                Confirmed == "Yes")
ggplot(data = cases) +
  geom_col(mapping = aes(
    x = Test,
    y = Count
    )
  )
```

But if we look at the number of cases we're letting through
it could be quite bad - we've missed 36!

Thus the reason we isolate for 14 days at the border,
even if a day 3 test returns negative.
