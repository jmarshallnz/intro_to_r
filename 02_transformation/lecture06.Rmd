## Learning outcomes

- Data wrangling with dplyr

- `summarise()` and `group_by()`.

---

## Data today

We'll use the data from Horizons Regional council on river quality again today.

```{r, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE}
hrc <- read_csv(here::here("data/horizons_river_quality/horizons_river_ecoli.csv"))
hrc
```

These data are available from Land, Air, Water Aoteoroa, https://www.lawa.org.nz/download-data/

# `dplyr`

---

## Recall `dplyr`

Just like `ggplot2` is a grammar of graphics, `dplyr` is a grammar of data manipulation.

It consists of a set of verbs that help us solve the most common data manipulation challenges:

- `select` to choose variables (columns) by name.
- `filter` to choose observations (rows) by value.
- `mutate` to add new variables based of existing variables.
- `summarise` to reduce multiple values down to a single summary.
- `arrange` changes the order of rows.

All of these combine with `group_by` to do all the above operation on subgroups of the data.

---

## Recall: the pipe `%>%`

The pipe operator, `%>%` takes the item on the left of the pipe and places it
as the first argument of the function on the right.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
hrc %>% filter(Value > 5000)
```

Is equivalent to:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
filter(hrc, Value > 5000)
```

But, the pipe version is readable as "Take the dataset `hrc` and filter it so that rows with Value > 5000 remain"

To enter a pipe in RStudio, you can use Ctrl-Shift-M (Command-Shift-M on a Mac).

---

## The pipe `%>%`

This extends naturally:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
hrc %>%
  filter(Value > 5000) %>%
  arrange(Site, Date)
```

reads "Take the dataset `hrc`, filter it so that rows with Value > 5000 remain, then arrange by Site and Date"

When constructing pipelines like this, make sure the `%>%` symbol is at the end of intermediate lines.

.left-code[
Use this:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
hrc %>%
  filter(Value > 5000) %>%
  arrange(Site, Date)
```
]

.right-plot[
Not this:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
hrc
 %>% filter(Value > 5000)
 %>% arrange(Site, Date)
```
]

---

## The pipe `%>%`

The pipe also gives us **code completion** by pressing the TAB key.

e.g. type:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
hrc %>% select(sit
```

and press the Tab key brings up a list of symbols starting with `sit`, which includes `Site` and `SiteID`.

This allows you to make sure you get the spelling correct :)

# Summarising rows

---

## Summarising rows with `summarise`

`summarise` computes summary statistics across all rows.

It generally takes lots of rows, performs some computation on one (or more) columns, and results in a single row output.

e.g. you can use this to compute means, medians, counts, totals or other summary statistics:

```{r}
hrc %>% summarise(Mean = mean(Value))
```

---

## Summarising rows with `summarise`

You can do as many summaries at once as you like:

```{r}
hrc %>% summarise(Mean = mean(Value),
                  Median = median(Value),
                  IQR = IQR(Value),
                  Count = n(),
                  Total = sum(Value),
                  Mean2 = Total / Count)
```

Notice in the `Mean2` computation, we're using columns that we computed earlier in the same `summarise()` command.

The `n()` function is useful for number of rows. Also `n_distinct()` for the number of distinct values.

---

## Summarising rows with `summarise`

You can use summaries that produce more than one result, and they'll be placed in multiple rows:

.pull-left[
```{r}
hrc %>%
  summarise(
    Quantile = quantile(Value)
    )
```

But, you need to make sure you know which is which!
]

--

.pull-right[
```{r}
hrc %>%
  summarise(
    Prob = c(0,0.25,0.5,0.75,1),
    Quantile = quantile(Value, probs=Prob)
    )
```

**Sticking to summaries that return a single value is safest.**
]

---

## Summarising rows with `summarise`

This can be combined with the other functions. e.g. to find a summary of counts at a common swimming location in summer:

```{r}
hrc %>%
  mutate(Month = month(Date, label = TRUE),
         Year = year(Date)) %>%
  filter(Site == "manawatu at u/s pncc stp",
         Month %in% c("Dec", "Jan", "Feb"),
         Year >= 2013) %>%
  summarise(Median = median(Value), Maximum = max(Value))
```

A count of 690 means the risk is around 6% of getting sick. The median risk is less than 0.1%.

# Grouping

---

## Grouping with `group_by`

The power of `dplyr` is that it can do all of the previous actions on subgroups of the data (all at once) rather than the entire data.

.pull-left[
```{r}
hrc %>% select(SiteID, Date, Value)
```
]

.pull-right[
```{r}
hrc %>% select(SiteID, Date, Value) %>% 
  group_by(SiteID)
```
]

---

.pull-left[

## Grouping with `group_by`

So while this produces a single row:

```{r}
hrc %>%
  summarise(Median = median(Value))
```
]

--

.pull-right[
## &nbsp;

This produces multiple rows, one for each year:

```{r}
hrc %>% mutate(Year = year(Date)) %>%
  group_by(Year) %>% 
  summarise(Median = median(Value))
```
]

---

```{r}
hrc %>%
  mutate(Year = year(Date)) %>%
  group_by(Year) %>% 
  summarise(Median = median(Value))
```

Notice the message here: `summarise` has ungrouped the output. This is because the groups no longer matter, as each group has just 1 row anyway.

---

## Grouping multiple variables

When you `group_by()` at more than one variable, the other verbs operate within unique combinations of those variables.

If you do a `summarise()` then you reduce the data down to one row for the inner-most variable. So it will drop this level of grouping, retaining grouping at higher levels.

```{r}
hrc %>%
  mutate(Year = year(Date)) %>%
  group_by(Site, Year) %>%
  summarise(Median = median(Value))
```

---

This means that subsequent operations happen at the `Site` level:

```{r}
hrc %>%
  mutate(Year = year(Date)) %>%
  group_by(Site, Year) %>%
  summarise(Median = median(Value)) %>%
  mutate(Overall = median(Median))
```

---

You can remove grouping with `ungroup()`:

```{r}
hrc %>%
  mutate(Year = year(Date)) %>%
  group_by(Site, Year) %>%
  summarise(Median = median(Value)) %>%
  ungroup() %>%
  mutate(Overall = median(Median))
```

---

## Counting

Another really helpful function that isn't one of the 6 main functions is `count()`.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
hrc %>% count(Site)
```

is equivalent to:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
hrc %>% group_by(Site) %>% summarise(n = n())
```

The function `add_count()` adds a count column instead of summarising.

---

.pull-left[
```{r}
hrc %>% count(Site)
```
]
.pull-right[
```{r}
hrc %>% add_count(Site) %>%
  select(Site, Value, n)
```
]

---

## Other helpers

`slice_min()` and `slice_max()` are useful for finding the top (or bottom) few entries.

.pull-left[
```{r}
hrc %>% select(Site, Value) %>%
  arrange(desc(Value)) %>%
  filter(row_number() <= 10)
```
]

.pull-right[
```{r}
hrc %>%
  select(Site, Value) %>%
  slice_max(Value, n=10)
```
]

---

## Other helpers

There are also `slice()` for taking rows out by row number, or `slice_head()` and `slice_tail()` for taking from the ends. `slice_sample()` can be used to take a random sample.

```{r}
hrc %>% slice_sample(n=10)
```

---

## Putting it all together

With the 6 main functions `select`, `arrange`, `filter`, `mutate`, `summarise` and `group_by` we can now answer many questions:

- Which are the best or worst sites on average (e.g. by Median)?

- Which sites do we not have much data on?

- Which sites are new?

- Which sites are tested infrequently?

---

Which sites are the **best** on average (by median)

```{r}
hrc %>% group_by(Site) %>%
  summarise(Median = median(Value)) %>%
  arrange(Median)
```

---

Which sites are the **worst** on average (by median)

```{r}
hrc %>% group_by(Site) %>%
  summarise(Median = median(Value)) %>%
  arrange(desc(Median))
```

---

Which sites are the **best** or **worst** on average (by median)

.pull-left[
```{r, message=FALSE}
hrc %>% group_by(Site) %>%
  summarise(Median = median(Value)) %>%
  slice_min(Median, n=5)
```
]

.pull-right[
```{r, message=FALSE}
hrc %>% group_by(Site) %>%
  summarise(Median = median(Value)) %>%
  slice_max(Median, n=5)
```
]

---

Which sites do we not have much data on?

```{r}
hrc %>% count(Site) %>% arrange(n)
```

---

Which sites are new?

```{r}
hrc %>% group_by(Site) %>%
  summarise(FirstDate = min(Date)) %>%
  arrange(desc(FirstDate))
```

---

Which sites are tested infrequently?

```{r}
hrc %>% group_by(Site) %>%
  summarise(DateRange = max(Date) - min(Date), Count = n()) %>%
  mutate(DaysPerTest = DateRange / Count) %>%
  arrange(desc(DaysPerTest))
```
